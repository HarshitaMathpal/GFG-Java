Given an array of size N consisting of only 0's and 1's. 
The array is sorted in such a manner that all the 1's are placed first and then they are followed by all the 0's. Find the count of all the 0's.

class Solution {
    int countZeroes(int[] arr, int n) {
        // code here
        int count =0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]==0){
                count++ ;
            }
           
        }
        return count; 
    }

}
